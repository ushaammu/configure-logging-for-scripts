# configure-logging-for-scripts
In this calculator script, the logging module is used to track the program’s behavior and record important events. Logging is configured at the start using logging.basicConfig(), which creates a file named app.log and stores messages with timestamps, log levels, and descriptions. Every time the calculator function calc() is called, an INFO log entry records the operation request, such as “Call: 10 + 5”. When specific issues occur—like dividing by zero—the script generates an ERROR log to make the problem easy to identify later. If the user enters an invalid operator, a WARNING log is created. Logging helps monitor the program without interrupting execution, making debugging easier and allowing developers to review past operations. Instead of printing internal problems to the screen, the script silently logs them in the background, ensuring clean output while still providing full traceability of all actions. This makes the script more professional and reliable.
